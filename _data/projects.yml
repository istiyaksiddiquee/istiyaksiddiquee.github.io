  repo: MagumOpus
  repo_URL: https://github.com/istiyaksiddiquee/MagumOpus
  img: '/images/magnum_opus_image.png'
  desc: An end-to-end data science project that gets the data from source, stores it in in-house, custom-made lakehouse-based data lakehouse and processes it with dbt. Then this data is used to develop ML model with distributed training, which is then deployed and monitored in a streaming-based scenario.

- name: 3D Medical Image Registration using Deep Learning  
  img: '/images/thumbnail_for_projects.PNG'
  desc: In this scientific team project, as part of master's coursework, we are working with proprietary 3D MRI images to develop a Deep Learning based registration system. As the project is still running and reserved under proprietary rights, repository link is not available for public viewing.

- name: Style Based Genre Classification of Gutenberg Corpus
  gh_user: istiyaksiddiquee
  repo: StyleBasedGenreClassification

  img: '/images/thumbnail_for_projects.PNG'
  desc: In this team project, we used a dataset of 19th century fictional literature, created by Gutenberg Project. We extracted, based on the research done by Douglas Biber, a custom feature vector of 23 dimension based on writing style. The challenge of the task was the imbalance nature of the dataset. Later, we compared the performances of multiple algorithms, along with neural network in classifying the books.
