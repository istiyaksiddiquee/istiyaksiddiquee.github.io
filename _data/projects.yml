  desc: In this team project, we used a dataset of 19th century fictional literature, created by Gutenberg Project. We extracted, based on the research done by Douglas Biber, a custom feature vector of 23 dimension based on writing style. The challenge of the task was the imbalance nature of the dataset. Later, we compared the performances of multiple algorithms, along with neural network in classifying the books.
